# let's say you need 6c change. Coins: 1 nickle + 1 penny
# 38 c: 1 quarter; 1 dime; 3 pennies

# write a function that takes an amount (up to 100 c) and tells you 
# change in minimum number of coins  

# write tests 
# write code to make tests work

# tests:
# input 1 c; result {penny: 1 nickle: 0 dime: 0 quarter: 0}
# input 5 c; result {penny: 0 nickle: 1 dime: 0 quarter: 0}
